# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
This repository implements basic neural network functionality in numpy. This is the code associated with the post in my blog [heinzerm.github.io]().

## Getting started

How to launch a training on MNIST:

`python3 training.py`

## Layers

Implemented layers:

* Linear
* Relu
* Softmax

## Loss functions

Implemented loss functions

* Mean Squared Error
* Mean Squared Error with Softmax
* Cross-Entropy
